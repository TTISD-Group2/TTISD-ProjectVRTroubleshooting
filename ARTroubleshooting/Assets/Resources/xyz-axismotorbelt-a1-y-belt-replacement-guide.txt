# Applicable Models of Printers

- **Model A1**

# Y-Belt for A1

The Y-belt is installed on the Y-axis. It connects the toolhead with the Y motor and drives the toolhead to move along the Y-axis.

# When to Use?

- It is worn.
- It is broken.

# Safety Warning

**IMPORTANT!**

It's crucial to **power off the printer** before conducting any maintenance work, including work on the printer's electronics and tool head wires. Performing tasks with the printer on can result in a short circuit, leading to electronic damage and safety hazards.

During maintenance or troubleshooting, you may need to disassemble parts, including the hotend. This exposes wires and electrical components that could short circuit if they contact each other, other metal, or electronic components while the printer is still on. This can result in damage to the printer's electronics and additional issues.

Therefore, it's crucial to **turn off the printer and disconnect it from the power source** before conducting any maintenance. This prevents short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics, ensuring safe and effective maintenance. For any concerns or questions about following this guide, we recommend submitting a **technical ticket** regarding your issue.

# Tools and Materials Needed

- New Y-belt (**Purchase link**: [Y Belt - A1](#))
- **H2.0 hex wrench**
- Tweezer
- 20 minutes

**Note**: When you receive the new Y belt, please first record the length of the new belt, then compare it with the length of the old belt. If the new belt is longer than the old belt, you need to shorten the belt by cutting 6 teeth from the side with more teeth.
