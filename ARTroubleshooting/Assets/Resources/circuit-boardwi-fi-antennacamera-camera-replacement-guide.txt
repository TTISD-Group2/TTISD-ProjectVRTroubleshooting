# Remove the A1 Live View Camera

### Safety Warning

**IMPORTANT!**

It's crucial to **power off the printer** before conducting any maintenance work, including work on the printer's electronics and tool head wires. Performing tasks with the printer on can result in a short circuit, leading to electronic damage and safety hazards.

During maintenance or troubleshooting, you may need to disassemble parts, including the hotend. This exposes wires and electrical components that could short circuit if they contact each other, other metal, or electronic components while the printer is still on. This can result in damage to the printer's electronics and additional issues.

Therefore, it's crucial to **turn off the printer and disconnect it from the power source before conducting any maintenance**. This prevents short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics, ensuring safe and effective maintenance. For any concerns or questions about following this guide, **open a new ticket in our Support Page** and we will do our best to respond promptly and provide the assistance you need.
