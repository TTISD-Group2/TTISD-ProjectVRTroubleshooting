# Verify the Functionality
Turn on the printer and start a filament loading procedure to check if the plastic is being extruded from the nozzle assembly correctly.

# Calibration Step After the Operation
Conduct a comprehensive calibration to ensure smooth operation of the printer. It is also advised to wash the PEI textured plate before use.

# Potential Problems and Solutions
- **The hotend temperature is 0**: Check and reconnect the Hotend Heating Assembly connector.
- **The hotend cannot be heated**: Check the heater wires and connections.
- **Printer is not homing correctly**: Check the Eddy Sensor wires and confirm correct installation.
- **Filament sensor is not working**: Check the Ribbon Cable and replace if damaged.
