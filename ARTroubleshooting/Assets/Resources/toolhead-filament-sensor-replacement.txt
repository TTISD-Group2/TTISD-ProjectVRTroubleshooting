# Step-by-Step Guide to Replace the Filament Sensor on the A1 3D Printer

## When to Use This Guide

This guide is intended for use if there is a problem with the Filament Sensor on the A1 3D printer. Common issues that indicate the need for replacement include:

- Filament is not detected by the printer during loading/unloading or printing.
- The printer frequently stops during printing, reporting problems with the filament.
- Recommended by Bambu Lab Technical Support.

**Note:** The filament sensor base must be replaced at the same time as the filament sensor. Please refer to the A1 series Filament Sensor Base Replacement Guide.

## Remove the Old Filament Sensor

### Step 1: Remove the Back Printhead Cover
1. Start by removing the back cover of the print head.
2. Carefully pry open the back cover by pulling on the bottom section.

### Step 2: Remove the USB C Cable from the Print Head
1. Remove the four screws holding the USB C cable secure on the tool head of the A1.
2. After removing the screws, pull the USB C cable upwards to remove it.

### Step 3: Remove the Toolhead Board Screws
1. Remove the three black screws holding the Toolhead Board in place.

### Step 4: Disconnect the Cables
1. Remove the four cables attached to the Toolhead Board by pulling them out by the connector.
2. Use a flat tool to gently pry them out to avoid any potential damage.
3. Also, remove the Eddy sensor wires, which are held in place by two screws.

### Step 5: Remove the Toolhead Board and Disconnect the Filament Sensor
1. Remove the Toolhead Board from the plastic housing.
2. Be careful when pulling it out, as you will need to carefully disconnect the filament sensor ribbon cable by pulling it slowly and straight upwards.

### Step 6: Remove the 4-in-1 Buffer and Sensor
1. Remove the 2 screws holding the 4-in-1 buffer attached to the extruder.
2. Gently raise it upwards and place it on the top of the print head.

### Step 7: Detach the Filament Sensor from the Buffer
1. Remove the filament sensor from the filament buffer by removing the two screws.
2. Completely pull out the filament sensor and its ribbon cable.

### Optional Step
- Check if the magnet located inside the filament buffer is in good condition.

## Install the New Filament Sensor

### Step 1: Attach the Filament Sensor to the Buffer
1. Attach the new filament sensor to the buffer using the two screws.
2. Remove the blue protection from the ribbon cable, then push the flex cable against the filament sensor to route it in place.

### Step 2: Install the Buffer to the Extruder
1. Put the filament buffer back in place, ensuring to route the ribbon cable towards the back of the print head.
2. Tighten the two screws on top.

### Step 3: Attach the Toolhead Board to the Housing
1. Open the clip on the TH board for the ribbon cable.
2. Gently push the cable in the connector, and close the clip.
3. **Note:** Pay close attention to the ribbon cable orientation when plugging it in.

### Step 4: Install the TH Board Screws
1. Use the three black screws to re-attach the Toolhead Board back to the print head.
2. **Important:** Do not overtighten the screws to avoid any potential damage.

### Step 5: Re-connect All the Cables
- **Hotend Heating Assembly**
- **Extruder Motor**
- **Hotend Cooling Fan**
- **Part Cooling Fan**
- **Eddy Sensor Wires**

### Step 6: Re-connect the USB-C Cable
1. Re-install the USB cable using the four screws removed earlier.
2. **Important:** Do not over-tighten these screws.

### Step 7: Install the Print Head Back Cover
1. Install the back cover of the A1 print head by aligning the two brackets towards the top, then push it until it clicks into place.

## Verify the Functionality

- Insert filament into any inlet of the toolhead. A green dot will appear on the icon in the lower right corner of the screen; remove the filament, and the green dot disappears, indicating that the filament sensor is working properly.

## Calibration Step After the Operation

- Conduct a full calibration of the printer after this operation.
- It's strongly advised to wash the PEI textured plate before use, as it may have been contaminated during this process.

## Potential Problems and Solutions

- **Filament Sensor is Not Working:**
  - Check the Ribbon Cable and confirm it is correctly installed.
  - Confirm the magnet inside the buffer is moving as expected and is free from any debris.
- **The Hotend Temperature is 0:**
  - Check the Hotend Heating Assembly connector and confirm it is correctly inserted.
- **The Hotend Cannot be Heated:**
  - Check the Hotend Heating Assembly connector.
- **Printer is Not Homing Correctly:**
  - Check the Eddy Sensor wires and confirm they are correctly installed.
