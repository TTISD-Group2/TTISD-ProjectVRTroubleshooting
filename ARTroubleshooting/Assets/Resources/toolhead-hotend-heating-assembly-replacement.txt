### Verify the functionality of the A1 hotend heating assembly

To ensure everything runs smoothly, set the hot end temperature to 100°C. If successful, the screen will show the temperature.

### Calibration step after the operation

We recommend conducting a full calibration of the printer after this operation. Additionally, it's strongly advised to **wash the PEI textured plate** before use, as it may have been contaminated during this process.

### Potential Problems and Solutions

- **The hotend temperature is 0℃**: Check the Hotend Heating Assembly connector and confirm it is correctly inserted. If the issue persists, the thermistor wires might have been damaged (white wires).
- **The hotend cannot be heated**: Check the Hotend Heating Assembly connector and confirm it is correctly inserted. If the issue persists, the heater wires might have been damaged (Translucent wires).
