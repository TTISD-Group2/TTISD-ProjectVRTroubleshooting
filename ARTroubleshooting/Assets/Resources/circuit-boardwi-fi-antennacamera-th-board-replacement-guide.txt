### Install the New TH Board

#### Step 1: Attach the TH Board to the housing
1. Reconnect the filament sensor ribbon cable on top of the board and close the clip that fixes the cable in place.
2. Route the Extruder Motor cable next to the ribbon cable.
3. Gently push the TH Board back into its position.

#### Step 2: Install the TH Board screws
1. Use the three black screws to re-attach the TH Board back to the toolhead.
   - **Important!** Do not overtighten the screws to avoid any potential damage.

#### Step 3: Re-connect all the cables
1. Reconnect the following cables:
   - **Hotend Heating Assembly**
   - **Extruder Motor**
   - **Hotend Cooling Fan**
   - **Part Cooling Fan**
   - **Hotend Sensor**

#### Step 4: Re-connect the USB-C cable
1. Reinstall the USB cable using the four screws removed earlier, making sure of the correct orientation.
   - **Important!** Do not over-tighten these screws to avoid damaging the threads. Ensure the line in the cable connector is aligned to the back of the printer and toolhead.

#### Step 5: Install the toolhead back cover
1. Align the two brackets on the back cover towards the top and push until it clicks into place.

### Calibration Step After the Operation
It's recommended to conduct a full calibration of the printer and wash the PEI textured plate before use to ensure optimal performance.

### Potential Problems and Solutions
- **Hotend temperature is 0**: Check the Hotend Heating Assembly connector and ensure it is correctly inserted. If issues persist, check for damage to the thermistor wires (White wires).
- **Hotend cannot be heated**: Confirm the Hotend Heating Assembly connector is correctly inserted. If issues persist, check for damage to the heater wires (Translucent wires).
- **Printer is not homing correctly**: Check the Eddy Sensor wires and confirm they are correctly installed.
- **Filament sensor is not working**: Check the Ribbon Cable and replace if damaged.
