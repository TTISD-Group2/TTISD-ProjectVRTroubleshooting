Safety Warning


IMPORTANT!

It's crucial to power off the printer before performing any maintenance work on the printer and its electronics, including tool head wires, because leaving the printer on while conducting such tasks can cause a short circuit, which can lead to additional electronic damage and safety hazards.

When you perform maintenane or troubleshooting on the printer, you may be required to disassemble some parts, including the hotend. This process can expose wires and electrical components that could potentially short circuit if they come into contact with each other or with other metal or electronic components while the printer is still on. This can damage the electronics of the printer and cause further damage.

Therefore, it's essential to switch off the printer and disconnect it from the power source before doing any maintenance work. This will prevent any short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics. By doing so, you can avoid potential damage to the printer's electronic components and ensure that the maintenance work is performed safely and effectively.

Steps to remove the old Power Supply

¶
1. Place the printer on its front

For easy access to the bottom section of the A1, you need to place the printer on the front.
Start by flipping the screen on its side, then gently place the printer on its front, as shown in the image below.

Use a box of filament to keep the top side raised to avoid putting pressure on the extruder and the screen.


¶
2. Remove the printer's bottom cover

Remove the 10 screws marked in red to prepare the bottom housing removal.
Please note that the screw marked in yellow needs to be loosened, but it will not be possible to remove it. It remains attached to the cable bracket.

3. Disconnect the wires and remove the wire bracket

In the next step, the Camera, Motor X and Motor Z cables need to be disconnected.
Then, you will be able to simply push the plastic wire bracket upwards, to disconnect the USB cable.



Important
If you cannot easily remove the wire bracket, make sure the screw holding it in place (labeled with Nr. 11 in the previous step) is loosened


After removing the wires, gently pry out the plastic bottom cover.

4. Remove the power supply screws

The A1 power supply is held in place by two screws, and plastic brackets.
First, remove the power supply screws shown in the image below.


¶
5. Loosen the power terminal screws

Loosen the power terminal screws listed in the image below.
Simply make them loose and
avoid removing them completely

6. Remove the Power Supply

With the power terminal screws loose, we can proceed in removing the power supply from the printer.
Gently push the plastic clips towards the bottom while also pulling the power supply towards you. This will release the power supply allowing for it to be removed from the printer frame.


Some power supply can be removed by removing only two screws

Do not push the clips too hard as they can break. They need to be pushed about 2-3mm so the power supply is removed.
Start with the first one then push the second one to release the power supply.
