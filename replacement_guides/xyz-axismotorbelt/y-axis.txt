Safety Warning
IMPORTANT!
It's crucial to
power off the printer before performing any maintenance work
on the printer and its electronics, including tool head wires, because leaving the printer on while conducting such tasks can cause a short circuit, which can lead to additional electronic damage and safety hazards.
When you perform maintenane or troubleshooting on the printer, you may be required to disassemble some parts, including the hotend. This process can expose wires and electrical components that could potentially short circuit if they come into contact with each other or with other metal or electronic components while the printer is still on.
This can damage the electronics of the printer and cause further damage.
Therefore, it's essential to
switch off the printer and disconnect it from the power source before doing any maintenance work
. This will prevent any short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics. By doing so, you can avoid potential damage to the printer's electronic components and ensure that the maintenance work is performed safely and effectively.
If you have any concerns or questions about following this guide,

Step 1 - Install the Y-Axis Track Bearing
Install the Y-Axis Track Bearing under the heatbed bracket and tighten the screws  (The method of installing the Y-Axis Track Bearing is the same)
Install the heatbed bracket onto the Y-axis Linear Rail. You need to check the installation direction

Step 3 - Install the Y Belt
Check the direction of the Y Belt, put the longer end of the tooth surface downward, and start threading the belt from the end of the Y tensioner;
Pushing and holding the movable part of the tensioner toward the rail allows the belt to pass through the idler pulley more easily;
Connect both ends of the Y Belt to the heatbed bracket, install the fixing plate, and lock in 2 screws on each plate to secure them.

Verify the Functionality
1. Move the heatbed bracket and confirm that the Y movement is smooth and the resistance is uniform;
2. Check the direction of the Y motor cable, the outlet cable is facing downward.
