Safety Warning


IMPORTANT!

It's crucial to
power off the printer before performing any maintenance work
on the printer and its electronics, including tool head wires, because leaving the printer on while conducting such tasks can cause a short circuit, which can lead to additional electronic damage and safety hazards.

When you perform maintenane or troubleshooting on the printer, you may be required to disassemble some parts, including the hotend. This process can expose wires and electrical components that could potentially short circuit if they come into contact with each other or with other metal or electronic components while the printer is still on.
This can damage the electronics of the printer and cause further damage.

Therefore, it's essential to
switch off the printer and disconnect it from the power source before doing any maintenance work
. This will prevent any short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics. By doing so, you can avoid potential damage to the printer's electronic components and ensure that the maintenance work is performed safely and effectively.

Release the tensioning spring and loosen the 2 tensioning screws with an H2.0 hex key  (Loose 1 turn);

Remove 4 screws with an H2.0 hex key, remove the 2 belt fixing plates, and remove the Y Belt.
































¶
Step 2- Remove the Y-Axis Tensioner

Remove 4 screws with an H2.0 hex key and then remove the Y Tensioner;

Remove 2 screws with an H2.0 hex key and then remove the spring hook.



















¶
Step 3-  Remove the Y Motor

Remove 4 screws with an H2.0 hex key and then remove the Y Motor

Remove 4 screws with an H2.0 hex key and then remove the  Y motor holder.

















¶
Step 4- Remove the Y-Axis Track Bearing

Remove the heatbed bracket from one end of the Y-axis Linear Rail;

Remove 1 screw and the Y-Axis Track Bearing  (The method of removing the 4 Y-Axis Track Bearings is the same)




















Please note that set a large torque for the 4  screws,  and screws come with screw glue. Be careful to prevent the nut from slipping.

Step 1 - Install the Y-Axis Track Bearing

Install the Y-Axis Track Bearing under the heatbed bracket and tighten the screws  (The method of installing the Y-Axis Track Bearing is the same)

Install the heatbed bracket onto the Y-axis Linear Rail. You need to check the installation direction

¶
Step 2 - Install the Y Motor

Install the Y motor holder and lock in 4 screws;

¶
Step 3 - Install the Y Belt

Check the direction of the Y Belt, put the longer end of the tooth surface downward, and start threading the belt from the end of the Y tensioner;

Pushing and holding the movable part of the tensioner toward the rail allows the belt to pass through the idler pulley more easily;

Connect both ends of the Y Belt to the heatbed bracket, install the fixing plate, and lock in 2 screws on each plate to secure them.





































Move the heatbed bracket to confirm that it moves smoothly, and install the tensioning torsion spring on the torsion spring holder















¶
Verify the Functionality

1. Move the heatbed bracket and confirm that the Y movement is smooth and the resistance is uniform;

2. Check the direction of the Y motor cable, the outlet cable is facing downward.















Note: If there is abnormal resistance on moving the heatbed bracket after installing the Y pulley bearing, you can adjust it by loosening the adjusting screw and the Y pulley bearing screw on the same side, and turning the adjusting plate.
