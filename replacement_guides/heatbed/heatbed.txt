This guide shows how to replace the Heatbed in the A1
[Image: heatbed.png]
Note:
The new version of the heatbed does not have the four
silicone covers. Also, there is only one hole for each screw. The new and old versions will be randomly shipped.
The old and new versions only differ in silicone covers and screw holes, without affecting normal work. The update is to avoid incorrect installation during replacement.

Safety Warning
Bambu Lab recently received reports involving unstable temperature readings and heating issues of the A1. Comprehensive investigation revealed that the cable connecting the heatbed and the base of the A1 is susceptible to premature fatigue.
Potential defects of the A1 may cause overheating, power loss or, in rare cases, even electric shorts or parts of the A1 or its surroundings to catch fire, so that users and by-standers are exposed to the risk of burns and electric shock.
IMPORTANT!
It's crucial to
power off the printer before performing any maintenance work
on the printer and its electronics, including tool head wires, because leaving the printer on while conducting such tasks can cause a short circuit, which can lead to additional electronic damage and safety hazards.
When you perform maintenane or troubleshooting on the printer, you may be required to disassemble some parts, including the hotend. This process can expose wires and electrical components that could potentially short circuit if they come into contact with each other or with other metal or electronic components while the printer is still on. This can, in addition, damage the electronics of the printer.
Therefore, it's essential to
switch off the printer and disconnect it from the power source before doing any maintenance work
. This will prevent any short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics. By doing so, you can avoid potential damage to the printer's electronic components and ensure that the maintenance work is performed safely and effectively.
If you have any concerns or questions about following this guide,
