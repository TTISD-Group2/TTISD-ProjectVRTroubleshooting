It's crucial to power off the printer before performing any maintenance work on the printer and its electronics, including tool head wires, because leaving the printer on while conducting such tasks can cause a short circuit, which can lead to additional electronic damage and safety hazards.  When you perform maintenane or troubleshooting on the printer, you may be required to disassemble some parts, including the hotend. This process can expose wires and electrical components that could potentially short circuit if they come into contact with each other or with other metal or electronic components while the printer is still on. This can damage the electronics of the printer and cause further damage.  Therefore, it's essential to switch off the printer and disconnect it from the power source before doing any maintenance work. This will prevent any short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics. By doing so, you can avoid potential damage to the printer's electronic components and ensure that the maintenance work is performed safely and effectively.  If you have any concerns or questions about following this guide, open a new ticket in our Support Page and we will do our best to respond promptly and provide you with the assistance you need.   ¶ Steps to remove the old Mainboard  ¶ 1.

You will need it after the replacement is completed.   The content of this QR code is the complete machine SN serial number, which is used to activate the device after replacing the mainboard.    ¶ 1. Re-connect the Mainboard wires to the power supply  Carefully re-connect the wires of the board to the power supply.  1. Red wire - Positive 2. Black wire - Negative 3. Longer black wire - Neutral   ¶ 2. Install the flat ribbon cable  To make the installation process easier, install the flexible ribbon cable before installing the A1 board.

This completes the installation process  ¶ Ask Customer Support for the SN activation  Please note that a new Mainboard will come with a new Serial Number. This means that the new board will need to be activated by Customer Support. To do so, please provide a picture of the SN displayed on the printer screen and wait for a confirmation. Please refer to this wiki: Activate New Serial Number-How to find SN . After this procedure is completed, the printer will update to the latest Serial Number, and you will be able to bind it to your account.  ¶ Verify the functionality  After the SN has been activated, bind the printer to your account.  To ensure everything works as expected, turn on the printer and try using it.  If the printer works as expected, the installation is completed successfully.  ¶ Calibration step after the operation  A full calibration is required after the Main Controller Board replacement procedure.  ¶ Potential problems and solutions  If you encounter problems during the installation of a new Motherboard, please check the potential problems and solutions listed below:  ¶ The printer doesn't power on  Confirm the Motherboard power wires are installed correctly, as shown in Step 1.
