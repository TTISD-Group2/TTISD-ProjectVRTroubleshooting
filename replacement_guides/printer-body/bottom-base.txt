Safety Warning
IMPORTANT!
It's crucial to
power off the printer before performing any maintenance work
on the printer and its electronics, including tool head wires, because leaving the printer on while conducting such tasks can cause a short circuit, which can lead to additional electronic damage and safety hazards.
When you perform maintenane or troubleshooting on the printer, you may be required to disassemble some parts, including the hotend. This process can expose wires and electrical components that could potentially short circuit if they come into contact with each other or with other metal or electronic components while the printer is still on.
This can damage the electronics of the printer and cause further damage.
Therefore, it's essential to
switch off the printer and disconnect it from the power source before doing any maintenance work
. This will prevent any short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics. By doing so, you can avoid potential damage to the printer's electronic components and ensure that the maintenance work is performed safely and effectively.
If you have any concerns or questions about following this guide,
open a new ticket in our Support Page
and we will do our best to respond promptly and provide you with the assistance you need.
