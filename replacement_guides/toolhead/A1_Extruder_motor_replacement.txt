Safety Warning
It's crucial to
power off the printer before conducting any maintenance work
, including work on the printer's electronics and tool head wires. Performing tasks with the printer on can result in a short circuit, leading to electronic damage and safety hazards.
During maintenance or troubleshooting, you may need to disassemble parts, including the hotend. This exposes wires and electrical components that could short circuit if they contact each other, other metal, or electronic components while the printer is still on.
This can result in damage to the printer's electronics and additional issues.
Therefore, it's crucial to
turn off the printer and disconnect it from the power source before conducting any maintenance
. This prevents short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics, ensuring safe and effective maintenance. For any concerns or questions about following this guide,
open a new ticket in our Support Page
and we will do our best to respond promptly and provide the assistance you need.

9.Re-connect the USB-C cable
Re-install the USB-C cable using the four screws we removed in the first step, while being careful about the orientation.
[Image: install_the_usb_cable_and_4_screws.jpeg]
Important!
Do not over-tighten these screws, as the threads can damage the plastic.
Take note of the USB-C cable orientation and the small groove from the back that aligns it.
The USB-C cable only fits in one position, with the correct orientation having the line in the cable connector aligned to the back of the printer and toolhead.

¶
Calibration step after the operation
It is suggested that you conduct a comprehensive calibration after replacing the extruder motor to ensure smooth operation of the printer.
Additionally, it's strongly advised to
wash the PEI textured plate before use
, as it may have been contaminated during this process.
