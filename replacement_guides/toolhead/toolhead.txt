Safety Warning
IMPORTANT!
It's crucial to
power off the printer before conducting any maintenance work
, including work on the printer's electronics and tool head wires. Performing tasks with the printer on can result in a short circuit, leading to electronic damage and safety hazards.
During maintenance or troubleshooting, you may need to disassemble parts, including the hotend. This exposes wires and electrical components that could short circuit if they contact each other, other metal, or electronic components while the printer is still on.
This can result in damage to the printer's electronics and additional issues.
Therefore, it's crucial to
turn off the printer and disconnect it from the power source before conducting any maintenance
. This prevents short circuits or damage to the printer's electronics, ensuring safe and effective maintenance. For any concerns or questions about following this guide,
open a new ticket in our Support Page
and we will do our best to respond promptly and provide the assistance you need.

Step 4 - Install the Extruder Module
Note
: Before installing the extruder, check whether the cables on both sides (eddy current coils and cooling fan for hotend cable on the left; part cooling fan cable and hotend heating assembly cable on the right) are well organized to avoid damage caused by squeezing the cables when installing the extruder. A broken eddy current coil may cause abnormal zero return, and a broken part cooling fan may cause a short circuit and fail to start.
