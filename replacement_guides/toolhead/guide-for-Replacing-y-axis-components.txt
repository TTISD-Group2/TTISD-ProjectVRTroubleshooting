# Remove the old Y-axis Linear Guide Assembly

### Step 1: Place the printer on its front

1. Flip the screen to its side.
2. Gently place the printer on its front, using a box of filament to keep the top side raised to avoid putting pressure on the extruder and the screen.

### Step 2: Disconnect the cable and remove the cable bracket

1. Loosen the yellow-marked screws (BT3-27) without completely removing them.
2. Disconnect the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cables, which are the camera, Z-axis motor, and X-axis motor respectively.
3. Push up the cable bracket to disconnect the USB-C cable.
   - **Note:** If it is not easy to remove the cable bracket, consider removing the screws completely and try again.

### Step 3: Remove the printer's bottom cover

1. Remove the 16 screws (BT3-8) at the bottom.
2. Remove the printer bottom cover.

### Step 4: Remove the bottom screws and the Y motor cable

1. Remove the two **fixing screws** on the ground cable (M3-6).
2. Remove the **fixing screws for the heat sink** and the **connector for the Y motor cable**.
3. Remove the Y motor connector and the cables from the routing trough.

### Step 5: Remove the heatbed and the Y-axis cover plate

1. Place the A1 printer on a flat surface and slowly raise the X-axis to the top.
2. Move the heatbed to the bottom and remove the cover on the Y-axis.
3. Use the H2.0 hex wrench to remove the 4 soft silicone sleeves from the heatbed.
4. Loosen the 4 screws (M3-6) that fix the heatbed, then remove the heatbed from the base and place it on the desktop.
   - **Note:** The latest version of the heatbed has removed the soft rubber stopper.

### Step 6: Remove the Y-axis Linear Guide Assembly

1. Move the Y-axis slide block to the front end and remove the 8 red-marked screws (M3-23) and 2 green-marked screws (BT3-23) shown in the diagram.
2. Move the pulley to the tail end and then remove the 2 green-marked screws at the front end.

# Install the new Y-axis Linear Guide Assembly

### Step 1: Install the new Y-axis Linear Guide Assembly

1. Pass the Y motor cable through from the bottom.
2. Insert a section of the tensioner into the base, then install the Y motor end.
3. Lock the black screw at the Y motor position to confirm the installation is in place.
4. Install four green-marked screws (BT3-23) at both ends, and then eight red-marked screws (M3-23) at the middle position.

### Step 2: Connect the Y motor cable and the bottom screws

1. Pass the Y motor cable through the bottom wiring trough.
2. Install two ground cable fixing screws (M3-6).
3. Connect the Y motor connector and tighten the fixing screws of the heat sink.

### Step 3: Install the printer bottom cover

1. Ensure the position of the cable bracket for the motor cable is correct before inserting the cable connector.
2. Install the bottom cover and lock in the 16 screws (BT3-8). Avoid over-tightening as these are self-tapping screws.

### Step 4: Install the wire bracket and connect the wires

1. Carefully align the wire bracket and push it downwards, ensuring the USB cable is fully pushed against the printer frame.
2. Tighten the screw (BT3-27) to lock it in place. Avoid overtightening as it is screwed into the plastic frame.
3. Re-connect the Camera, Motor X, and Motor Z cables.

### Step 5: Install the heatbed component and the Y-axis cover plate

1. Carefully align the heatbed metallic frame to the two metallic stands on the Y-axis, ensuring the screw holes of the bed are aligned.
2. Install the four screws (M3-6) on the heatbed.
3. Install the four silicone covers removed earlier.
4. Move the heatbed forward to the end, pass the Y-axis cover from beneath the heatbed through, and push it forward to the end. Align the snap fasteners and install the Y-axis cover in place.

# Printer Calibration
